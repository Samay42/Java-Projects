# Library Management System

## Description

The Library Management System is a simple console-based Java application designed to manage books, library members, and book loans. This project serves as an exercise to understand core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Features

- Add and Remove Books: Manage a collection of books in the library.
- Register Members: Allow users to register as library members.

   ```

3. Compile the Java Files:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java Book.java Member.java Library.java
   ```

4. Run the Application:
